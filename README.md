# Project-phase-1
# Aircraft Risk Assessment for Strategic Aviation Expansion 

## Overview

Tthis repository contains an analysis of aviation data to support the company's diversification into the aviation industry. The goal is to identify low-risk aircraft for both commercial and private enterprises. Data-driven insights are provided to guide the selection of aircraft that minimize safety risks and optimize operational efficiency.

## Business Understanding.

### Stakeholders 

Executive Team: Determines investment strategy and risk mitigation.
New Aviation Division: Implements aircraft acquisition and operational processes.

## Business Questions 

- Why does aviation safety incidents occur and how to mitigate these risks?

- How do operational factors affects the severity of incidents?

- What are geographical factors and how do they affect rates of incidents?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of Data
The data was sourced from historical aviation safety records, containing details on incidents, injuries, weather, and flight phases.

### Description of Data
#### The dataset includes:
